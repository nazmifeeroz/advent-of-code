## Day 1 - Chronal Calibration

### Part 1

> For example, if the device displays frequency changes of +1, -2, +3, +1, then starting from a frequency of zero, the following changes would occur:

> Current frequency 0, change of +1; resulting frequency 1.
> Current frequency 1, change of -2; resulting frequency -1.
> Current frequency -1, change of +3; resulting frequency 2.
> Current frequency 2, change of +1; resulting frequency 3.
> In this example, the resulting frequency is 3.

> Here are other example situations:

> +1, +1, +1 results in 3
> +1, +1, -2 results in 0
> -1, -2, -3 results in -6
> Starting with a frequency of zero, what is the resulting frequency after all of the changes in frequency have been applied?
